# Orbz engineering instructions

This repository owns only the `@neongate-ai/orbz` npm package.

## Required reading order

12. `.agents/rules/011-public-orb-installer.rule.md`
13. `.agents/rules/012-agent-runtime-guardrails.rule.md`
14. The relevant SPEC and linked ADRs.

## Repository boundaries

- Keep `<orb-z>` as the single runtime UI implementation.
- Keep the package framework-agnostic and SSR-safe.
- Do not add documentation-site code or framework example applications here.
- Do not add runtime framework wrappers.
- Keep provider secrets and product conversation copy outside the package.
- Treat public API additions as compatibility commitments.
- Run `./cli/orb check` before completing a release-oriented change.

## Harness, CLI, and Git gates

- `.agents/` contains context, ADRs, rules, specs, prompts, skills, and explicit workflows.
- `.audits/` contains deterministic repository checks.
- `./cli/orb help` lists the shell-only local engineering commands.
- Husky hooks are thin adapters; Orb owns pre-commit and commit-message behavior.
- `.cursor/hooks.json` enforces agent shell guardrails and fast post-edit feedback; release/publication boundaries remain human-controlled.
- `.agents/workflows/` contains explicit reusable task sequences; use them instead of inventing ad hoc release or regression procedures.
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits and package versions follow SemVer.
- Executable Vitest suites are colocated with source under `src/`.
- Start behavioral changes with a SPEC and link an ADR when architecture changes.
- Keep a `readme.md` in every directory under `.agents/` and `.audits/`.

## Task routing

- Regression: use `.agents/workflows/regression-fix.md` plus the relevant domain skill.
- Review: use `.agents/workflows/review.md`; the optional Cursor `orbz-reviewer` subagent is review-only.
- Release: use `.agents/workflows/release.md`; agents must stop for human approval at tag/push/publish boundaries.
- Harness improvement: use `.agents/workflows/harness-improvement.md` and Rule 012.

## Engineering harness command

Run `./cli/orb harness` explicitly when the repository harness needs scoring or reconciliation. Harness tooling is engineering-only and must never run automatically from install, build, test, or CI lifecycle hooks.
