# Release context

Intentional package payload consists of `dist/`, the POSIX shell `cli/`, and
npm's automatic root metadata files. Source maps are disabled. Provider secrets,
tests, Git hooks, `.agents/`, and `.audits/` must not enter the package. The CLI
is included only to provide the `orb` package binary and explicit npx project
setup.

Commit messages follow Conventional Commits. Release planning maps `fix` and
`perf` to patch changes, `feat` to minor changes, and `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE`
to major changes. `package.json#version` must be canonical SemVer. A staged
version change must move forward relative to `HEAD`.

A release-oriented source change runs `orb check`; CI also lints commit history
through the checked-in Orb entry point and runs `npm pack --dry-run`. The
`prepack` lifecycle delegates to the same Orb gate. New exports, attributes,
properties, methods, events, package binaries, and entry points are compatibility
commitments and require an explicit SPEC plus an ADR when the commitment is
architectural.

`package.json#scripts` does not mirror the Orb command surface. A root-only local
`pnpm:devPreinstall` hook provisions the managed source-checkout launcher, `setup`
is its recovery bridge, and `prepack` is the npm release gate. After local source
setup, engineering commands use `orb <command>` directly.

Consumer project setup remains explicit through
`npx -y --package=@neongate-ai/orbz@latest orb`. Standard dependency lifecycles
`preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`, and `prepare` do not provision repository
state or a user launcher for application consumers. Harness-score remains
explicit engineering-only tooling and is never part of the runtime API.

ADR-0018/SPEC-027 retain `@neongate-ai/orbz` for npm while `gojhonny/orbz` remains
the GitHub repository. Existing dependency/import strings stay valid.
ADR-0019/SPEC-028 restore NeonGate (`neongate`) as the canonical default and keep
the accidentally published `gojhonny` name only as a deprecated compatibility
alias. The correction carries forward main's 1.0.1 metadata into staging without
a new bump or publication. npm consumers receive it only with a future release;
until then, examples can select NeonGate through `DEFAULT_ORBZ_PRESET` or omit
the explicit preset, preserving compatibility with the existing 1.0.1 package.
Configure the existing npm package's publisher for the current GitHub repository;
the npm and GitHub account names do not need to match. Never overwrite a published
version or move its release tag.

Agent runtime guardrails deny autonomous package publication and require human approval for tag, push, merge/rebase, and PR-merge boundaries. These hooks supplement, but do not replace, Orb checks, Git hooks, and CI.
